# Burnout Paradise Remastered *(PC version)*

A central list for bugs within the PC version of the game [Burnout Paradise Remastered](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/burnout/burnout-paradise-remastered). Note that while this issue tracker is focused on the PC remaster, many of the bugs faced are not necessarily PC-specific or in some cases not even specific to the remaster.

The milestones on the issues are the version of [my bugfix mod](https://bpr.bo98.uk/) which fixes the issue. The issue is closed when that version is released.
